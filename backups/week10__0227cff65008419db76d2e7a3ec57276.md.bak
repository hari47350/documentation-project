__Project:__ smartidh3  
__Task:__ Hardened MongoDB backup setup  
__Date:__ 2025\-10\-24

```python title="teama week10 (snippet 2)"
<a id="objective"></a>## Objective

```
- Ensure a reliable backup strategy for MongoDB collections: parsed\_segments, extracted\_entities, raw\_documents, users\.
- Make backups reproducible from VS Code or PowerShell, even when the Python virtual environment is active\.

```python title="teama week10 (snippet 3)"
<a id="approach"></a>## Approach

```
1. __Install MongoDB Database Tools__
```python title="teama week10 (snippet 4)"
	- Installed the official [MongoDB Database Tools](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/database-tools) on Windows\.
	- Verified mongodump version:

```
- mongodump version: 100\.13\.0

1. __Create PowerShell Backup Script__
```python title="teama week10 (snippet 5)"
	- File: scripts/backup\_mongo\.ps1
	- Features:
		- Generates timestamped backup folders\.
		- Dumps all collections of mydb to \.bson files\.
		- Uses __full path to mongodump\.exe__ to avoid PATH issues in virtual environments\.
		- Creates backup folder if it does not exist\.
```
2. __Run Backup__
```python title="teama week10 (snippet 6)"
	- Activated virtual environment:
	- & C:/Users/admin/smartidh3/\.venv/Scripts/Activate\.ps1
	- Ran backup script:
	- \.\\scripts\\backup\_mongo\.ps1
	- Verified all collections dumped successfully:
	- parsed\_segments: 25403 documents  
```
extracted\_entities: 3 documents  
raw\_documents: 1 document  
users: 1 document
3. __Results__
```python title="teama week10 (snippet 7)"
	- Backup folder created: C:\\backups\\mongo\_YYYYMMDD\_HHMMSS
	- All target collections saved as \.bson files\.
	- Backup works from VS Code terminal, standard PowerShell, or any PowerShell with virtual environment active\.

<a id="advantages-of-this-approach"></a>## Advantages of This Approach

```
- Fully automated and repeatable\.
- Independent of virtual environment PATH issues\.
- Timestamped folders provide versioned backups\.
- Compatible with Windows and VS Code\.

```python title="teama week10 (snippet 8)"
<a id="next-steps-recommendations"></a>## Next Steps / Recommendations

```
- Set up __Windows Task Scheduler__ for automatic daily backups\.
```python title="teama week10 (snippet 9)"
- Implement a __retention policy__ \(e\.g\., delete backups older than 30 days\)\.
```
- Periodically test __restore process__ with mongorestore\.

```python title="teama week10 (snippet 10)"
<a id="usage"></a>## Usage

```
\# Run backup from project root  
\.\\scripts\\backup\_mongo\.ps1  
  
\# Example output  
Backup completed successfully at: C:\\backups\\mongo\_20251024\_172252
