# Presentation Document: Exception Handling in Code

## Meeting Objective

Explain best practices for exception handling to the development team with examples, focusing on predictable error management, logging, and providing clear feedback to users\.

## Agenda

1. Introduction to Exception Handling
2. Importance of Exception Handling
3. Key Principles of Exception Handling
	- Using try\-except blocks
	- Specific exception types
	- Raising exceptions
	- Logging errors
	- Failing gracefully
4. Examples and Best Practices
5. Q&A

## 1\. Introduction to Exception Handling

- Exception handling is the process of anticipating and managing runtime errors\.
- It ensures the program can continue or fail gracefully without crashing\.

## 2\. Importance of Exception Handling

- Prevents unexpected program crashes\.
- Provides meaningful error messages for troubleshooting\.
- Helps maintain software reliability and robustness\.

## 3\. Key Principles of Exception Handling

### 3\.1 Using try\-except Blocks

- Wrap code that might fail in a try block\.
- Handle expected errors in the except block\.

```text title="week2.md snippet 1"
__Example:__
```

```text title="week2.md snippet 2"
try:
```

 \# 1\. The Risky Action 
 
 result = 10 / divisor 
```text title="week2.md snippet 3"
except ZeroDivisionError: 
 print\("Error: Cannot divide by zero\."\)
```

### 3\.2 Specific Exception Types

- Catch specific exceptions instead of using a generic except\.
- it allows you to handle different errors in different ways and prevents you from accidentally hiding unexpected bugs\.
- Avoid catching too broadly to prevent masking other errors\.

```text title="week2.md snippet 4"
__Example:__
```

```text title="week2.md snippet 5"
try: 
 user\_input = int\(input\("Enter a number: "\)\) 
except ValueError: 
 print\("Invalid input: Please enter a valid integer\."\)
```

### 3\.3 Raising Exceptions

- Raise exceptions when invalid conditions occur\.
- Provides clarity and control over error conditions\.

```text title="week2.md snippet 6"
__Example:__
```

```python title="week2.md snippet 7"
def calculate\_area\(radius\): 
 if radius < 0: 
 raise ValueError\("Radius cannot be negative"\) 
```
 return 3\.14 \* radius \*\* 2

### 3\.4 Logging Errors

- Use logging to record error details for troubleshooting\.
- Avoid printing sensitive data directly to users\.

```text title="week2.md snippet 8"
__Example:__
```

```python title="week2.md snippet 9"
import logging 
```
 
```text title="week2.md snippet 10"
logging\.basicConfig\(level=logging\.ERROR\) 
try: 
 process\_data\(data\) 
except KeyError as e: 
 logging\.error\(f"Missing key in data: \{e\}"\) 
 print\("Error processing data\. Contact support\."\)
```

### 3\.5 Failing Gracefully

- Ensure the program can recover or exit safely\.
- Provide user\-friendly messages and cleanup resources if needed\.

```text title="week2.md snippet 11"
__Example:__
```

```text title="week2.md snippet 12"
try:
```

 \# 1\. The Risky Action 
```text title="week2.md snippet 13"
 file = open\('data\.txt'\) 
except FileNotFoundError:
```

 \# 2\. The Graceful Recovery 
```text title="week2.md snippet 14"
 print\("File not found\. Please check the file path\."\) 
else:
```

 \# 3\. The "Success" Path and Cleanup 
```text title="week2.md snippet 15"
 data = file\.read\(\) 
 file\.close\(\) \# <\-\- Important cleanup step
```
