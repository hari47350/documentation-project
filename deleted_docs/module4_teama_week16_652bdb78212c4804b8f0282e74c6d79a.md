```python title="teama week16 (snippet 1)"
<a id="smartidh3-integration-test-runbook"></a># SmartIDH3 Integration Test Runbook

```
__Purpose:__ Test end\-to\-end integration: ingest documents into MongoDB → Chroma → backup binary to AWS S3 → create pointer in MongoDB → verify backup/restore\.

```python title="teama week16 (snippet 2)"
<a id="prerequisites"></a>## __Prerequisites__

```
1. __Python Environment__
```python title="teama week16 (snippet 3)"
	- Python 3\.10\+ installed
	- Virtual environment activated:
	- & C:/Users/admin/smartidh3/\.venv/Scripts/Activate\.ps1
```
2. __Dependencies__

- pip install pymongo chromadb boto3

1. __MongoDB__
```python title="teama week16 (snippet 4)"
	- Running on localhost:27017
	- Database: test\_integration
	- Collection: test\_collection
```
2. __Chroma__
```python title="teama week16 (snippet 5)"
	- Chroma client installed
```
3. __AWS S3__
```python title="teama week16 (snippet 6)"
	- AWS account with access key and secret key
	- Environment variables set \(replace with your keys\):
	- \[Environment\]::SetEnvironmentVariable\("AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY\_ID", "<your\_access\_key>", "User"\)  
\[Environment\]::SetEnvironmentVariable\("AWS\_SECRET\_ACCESS\_KEY", "<your\_secret\_key>", "User"\)  
\[Environment\]::SetEnvironmentVariable\("AWS\_DEFAULT\_REGION", "us\-east\-1", "User"\)

<a id="steps-to-run"></a>## __Steps to Run__

```
1. Navigate to the integration test directory:

- cd C:\\Users\\admin\\smartidh3\\integration\_test\_setup

1. Run the smoke test:

- python smoke\_test\.py

```python title="teama week16 (snippet 7)"
<a id="expected-output"></a>## __Expected Output__

```
Inserted new document into MongoDB / Document already exists in MongoDB  
MongoDB test passed: \[\.\.\.\]  
```python title="teama week16 (snippet 8)"
Chroma test passed: \{\.\.\.\}  
```
Created S3 bucket: test\-backup\-xxxxxx  
✅ Uploaded 'test\_binary\.pdf' to S3 bucket 'test\-backup\-xxxxxx'  
Inserted pointer document into MongoDB  
Backup & restore verified ✅  
```python title="teama week16 (snippet 9)"
Cleanup completed ✅  \(if cleanup enabled\)  
```
Integration test completed successfully ✅

```python title="teama week16 (snippet 10)"
<a id="verification"></a>## __Verification__

```
1. __MongoDB__
```python title="teama week16 (snippet 11)"
	- Original document \(id=1\)  

	- Pointer document \(id=binary\_1\) with S3 URI
```
2. __Chroma__
```python title="teama week16 (snippet 12)"
	- Collection test\_collection contains document Test Document 1
```
3. __AWS S3__
```python title="teama week16 (snippet 13)"
	- Navigate to S3 console → bucket test\-backup\-xxxxxx
	- Ensure test\_binary\.pdf exists
	- Optional: download and compare with local file

<a id="cleanup-reset"></a>## __Cleanup / Reset__

- Optional, already in script \(comment out if you want to retain data\):
	- Delete S3 object & bucket  

	- Remove pointer from MongoDB  

	- Reset Chroma collection

<a id="notes"></a>## __Notes__

```
- Script is idempotent: can safely run multiple times  

- Each run creates a __unique S3 bucket__ to prevent conflicts  

- Environment variables should __not__ be committed to source control  

- Designed for __dev/test stack__ verification
